# Module-3-Challenge

## Description

This program is used to generate a password using Javascript. Array's of special characters, numeric numbers, lowercase numbers and uppercase numbers are used to make up the password. Using a function, a random character from the array's is chosen. Then conditional statements are used to check for the criteria for the password. This criteria includes a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Next variable's are created to store the boolean values of the characters used to make up the password. Then a conditional statement is used to check if the user does not include any types of the characters. A function is then created to generate a password. In this function the arrays of the characters are grouped together in a new variable called "possibleChar". Then using a for loop, the characters in the "possibleChar" variable are made into a password.
